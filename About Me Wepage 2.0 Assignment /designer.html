           I constantly revisit this waterfall. Every time I revisit it is a different season and there is always something different about it. At first there was a small lake beneath the waterfall, then the second time a river ran next to the lake.

           The third time, when looking at it through the viewing site, I could feel sprits of water falling over me. It's as if nature, similar to human beinggs, evolves and grows beautifully with age.
